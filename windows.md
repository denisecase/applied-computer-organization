# Windows Instructions

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for completing required tasks on a Windows system using File Explorer.

## Task 1: Use C:\Projects not C:\Documents

Windows often syncs the `Documents` folder with OneDrive, which can cause confusion and potential issues for file management. 
We STRONGLY recommend you create a local Projects folder instead.

Steps
1. Open File Explorer.
2. Navigate to This PC > Local Disk (C:)
3. Create a new folder in the root C:\ named Projects.

Keep all your project repositories in your Projects folder - NOT your Documents folder (that may be syncing with OneDrive).

## Task 2: Create and Organize Folders in the C:\Projects Directory

Organize project repositories in your C:\Projects folder.

Steps
1. Open File Explorer.
2. Click the View tab on the ribbon.
3. In the Show/Hide group, check the box labeled File name extensions.
4. In the Show/Hide group, check the box labeled Hidden items.

## Task 4: OPTIONAL: Confirm OneDrive is Not Syncing Your Work

OPTIONAL: Confirm that your work stays local and is not synced to OneDrive.

Steps
1. Check the OneDrive icon in the taskbar (lower right corner).
2. Right-click the icon and select Settings.
3. Under the Account tab, review the folders being synced.
4. Ensure the local Documents folder (`C:\Projects`) is not listed.
