# Windows Instructions

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for completing required tasks on a Windows system using File Explorer.

IMPORTANT: There are two "Documents" folders on new Windows 11 machines. 
For project work, we recommend NOT using the default OneDrive folder and using your local Documents folder instead. 

## Task 1: Identify Your Local Documents Folder (NOT the OneDrive Documents folder)

Windows often syncs the `Documents` folder with OneDrive, which can cause confusion and potential issues for file management. 
We STRONGLY recommend you use the local folder (`C:\Users\<username>\Documents`).

Steps
1. Open File Explorer.
2. Navigate to This PC > Local Disk (C:) > Users > Your Username > Documents.
3. Confirm this path in the address bar of File Explorer:
   - It should start with `C:\Users\<username>\Documents`.
4. Avoid using the OneDrive-synced Documents folder, which often starts with `C:\Users\<username>\OneDrive\Documents`.

## Task 2: Create and Organize Folders in the Local Documents Directory

Organizing files in your local Documents folder ensures that your work is not unintentionally synced or lost.

Steps
1. Navigate to your local Documents folder (`C:\Users\<username>\Documents`).
2. Create a new folder by right-clicking in the folder, selecting New > Folder, and using your name (e.g., `Use_This_Docs_Folder_YourName`). Replace Yourname with your name for verification.

## Task 3: Show File Extensions and Hidden Items

Steps
1. Open File Explorer.
2. Click the View tab on the ribbon.
3. In the Show/Hide group, check the box labeled File name extensions.
4. In the Show/Hide group, check the box labeled Hidden items.

Verify
- In your C:\Users\<username>\Documents\ folder, create a file that might typically be hidden, e.g. .yourname (where the file name is just dot yourname).
- Take a screenshot showing the contents of your C:\Users\<username>\Documents\ folder with both the folder you made and this new file. 


## Task 3: OPTIONAL: Set File Explorer to Always Open the Local Documents Folder

This ensures quick access to your files without accidentally opening the synced OneDrive version.

Steps
1. Open File Explorer.
2. Click the View tab and select Options (on the far right).
3. In the Folder Options window:
   - Under Open File Explorer to, select This PC instead of Quick Access.
4. Click OK to save changes.

## Task 4: OPTIONAL: Confirm OneDrive is Not Syncing Your Work

OPTIONAL: Confirm that your work stays local and is not synced to OneDrive.

Steps
1. Check the OneDrive icon in the taskbar (lower right corner).
2. Right-click the icon and select Settings.
3. Under the Account tab, review the folders being synced.
4. Ensure the local Documents folder (`C:\Users\<username>\Documents`) is not listed.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

- Accidentally Saved to OneDrive?  
  Move the file back to `C:\Users\<username>\Documents` by dragging it in File Explorer.

- Still Confused About Which Folder?  
  Compare the folder paths in the address bar of File Explorer. Avoid paths that include `OneDrive`.

- Need More Organization?  
  Create subfolders in your local Documents folder to categorize your files further.

This guide ensures you're working in the correct local directory, avoiding potential issues with OneDrive syncing or misplaced files.
